Favorite Labs
-------------

1. Lab 5, part 1
 * I like this lab because it was practical. It has real-world applications, and ones that actually show usefulness. This lab can be used as a calculator. Given, it is only useful for multiplication, but it can be modified to be used for all other kinds of operations.

2. Lab 5, part 2
 * I like this lab because it is also useful. Converting from feet in decimals
 * to feet and inches and backwards is alwaqys annoying to do and is
 * surprisingly common. It is nice to know that I now have a tool to help me
 * with this conversion

3. Lab 6, part 2
 * This lab was great also because it proved to be useful. On holidays, my
 * family would play a bit of blackjack(don't worry, we didn't actually
 * gamble ), and it would have been nice to have something like this
 * to know how to play.
